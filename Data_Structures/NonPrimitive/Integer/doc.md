The provided assembly code in x86 demonstrates how to add two integers and store the result. It declares three variables (`a`, `b`, and `sum`) in the data section, initializing `a` and `b` with values 10 and 20, respectively. In the text section, starting at the `_start` label, it loads the value of `a` into the `eax` register, adds the value of `b` to `eax`, and then stores the result in `sum`. The program then makes a system call to exit, setting `eax` to 1 (the system call number for exit) and `ebx` to 0 (the exit status code), before invoking the interrupt `int 0x80` to terminate the program.
